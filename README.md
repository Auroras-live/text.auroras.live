# text.auroras.live

This is the code that powers http://text.auroras.live. It uses the Auroras.live API's `jsonp` format to display basic aurora hunting information.

To use this, simply run this file from your local machine, or put it on a web server and navigate to it. This code runs client-side, so no server-side scripting is required.
